I made quite a few changes, most dramatically to the UtilClockTimer class which
I completely rewrote from the ground up, I took a lot of ideas on how to
implement this timer(and the SimpleClockTimer) from the source of the
java.util.timer class(specifically the jdk8 (yes 8 not 7) version). I did not
copy the code or anything just used it to write a more structured base for my
timers, which is really what I should've done in the first place. I want to make
clear the fact that I simply used the original code as an idea, there are some
remnants of it in my code but the vast majority of what I wrote was purely my
own.I made some changes to the clock class, but only in the areas regarding
timers(i.e I didn't change any of the actual mechanics of the clock itself). I
made changes to the timers in pretty much every area, i redid the
synchronization, redid the timer catch up methods, redid the creation and
excution of timer tasks and redid the creation of threads to run the
tasks. There is at the moment still a slight problem with ActiveClocks catching
up if updates are missed, but otherwise everything(including the bonus) passes
fine. Also I just want to apologize about the output from my original code, I am
not 100% sure why it gave so much output, but that really was a problem that I
should've noticed.
